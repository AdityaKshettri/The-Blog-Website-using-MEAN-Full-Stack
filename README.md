# The Blog Website using MEAN Full Stack :

In this project, I have worked on Full Stack Web Development using Node.js as Backend server and Angular.js as Frontend platform to perform CRUD Operations on Blog using MongoDB. Here, I have worked with the backedn as well as the frontend in the same project for the ease of access. You can do it differently if you wish to.

# Project Website : 
Frontend ==> http://the-mean-angular-node-app.s3-website.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/
Backend ==> http://meanapp-env.eba-mkvikfs9.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/

# How to work with this project :

1- Download the entire project and open it in Visual Studio Code after unzipping.

2- Download the required dependencies in the package.json file using:
> npm install

3- Run the node backend server in the terminal by running the server.js file in backend folder using:
> npm run start:server

4- Goto the http://localhost:3000/api/posts to see all the posts saved in the mongodb.

5- Open a new terminal and run the angular frontend server using:
> ng serve

6- Goto the http://localhost:4200/ to see the project homepage. 

7- You can perform all CRUD operations on your Blogs as well as see the blogs of other users too.
